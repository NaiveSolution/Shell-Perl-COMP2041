11/7/20 13:33   14:33   Coding          Implementation of shrug-commit [-a]. Just reused existing code.
12/7/20 15:14   16:10   Understanding   Playing around with the ref. shrug-rm to discover all the errors.
13/7/20 10:00   12:30   Coding          Had to change/refactor code. Decided to create logs for rm and add
13/7/20 13:00   16:00   Coding          Struggling with shrug-rm. But finally got it finished to pass all tests
14/7/20 10:00   12:00   Coding          Took unnecessarily long to code shrug-status, using the most naive method.
14/7/20 12:00   17:00   Coding          Wrote the helper function, shrug-update, also using the most naive methods.
15/7/20 12:00	23:40	Coding		So many problems with my helper function that I had to rewrite all of shrug-status and shrug-update. 

Finished (decided against subset-2)
